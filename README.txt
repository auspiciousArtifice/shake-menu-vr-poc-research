This is a research project I contributed to in order test out the viability of a novel user interaction method, called shake menus, in VR. 

In this repository, you'll find the source code for a tech demo showcasing shake menus alongside traditional point and click menus for ease of comparison as well as a paper that my colleague and I wrote on shake menus (their benefits, complications, and overall usability). Here is a link to a video that shows how users can interact with the tech demo: https://youtu.be/BEcxxFQL5rg

We made the demo with hand tracking in mind, so unfortunately, the only way to properly run it is on an Oculus Quest.
